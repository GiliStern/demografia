# Demographia Arsenal Report: Comprehensive Mechanics & Satirical Design

## 1.0 Introduction: The Weaponization of Culture

This report provides a strategic and technical deconstruction of the weapons systems in the game _Demographia_. It evaluates them as both distinct gameplay mechanics and pillars of satirical commentary.

By mirroring the established logic of _Vampire Survivors_, _Demographia_ lowers the barrier to entry, allowing the player to focus on the game's core design philosophy: **"Weapons of Mass Culture."** Everyday Israeli objects—from plastic chairs to prickly pears—are transformed into instruments of chaotic defense.

## 2.0 Core Weapon Mechanics

All weapons in _Demographia_ operate under a unified physics and logic engine derived from the genre standard:

- **Auto-Fire Protocol:** Attacks trigger automatically based on a `Cooldown` stat.
- **Attribute Scaling:** Weapons scale via six primary stats: **Might** (Damage), **Area** (Size), **Speed** (Projectile Velocity), **Duration** (Effect Length), **Amount** (Projectile Count), and **Cooldown** (Fire Rate).
- **Evolutionary Logic:** To evolve a weapon, the player must:
  1.  Upgrade the weapon to **Level 8** (Max).
  2.  Possess the specific corresponding **Passive Item**.
  3.  Open a Treasure Chest (after the 10-minute mark).

## 3.0 Detailed Weapon Profiles

### 3.1 Weapon: צבר (Sabra)

**VS Equivalent:** Magic Wand

#### Mechanical Profile

The **Sabra** is the default projectile weapon. It fires prickly pear fruits at the nearest enemy. It is a low-maintenance weapon that provides consistent close-range defense.

- **Targeting:** Auto-Targeting (Nearest Enemy).
- **Base Damage:** 10
- **Base Cooldown:** 1.2 seconds
- **Physics:** Projectiles ignore duration; they travel until they hit an enemy or leave the screen.

#### Progression Table (Levels 1–8)

| Level | Effect / Upgrade                                  |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Base Weapon. Fires 1 projectile at nearest enemy. |
| **2** | +1 Amount (Fires 1 additional projectile).        |
| **3** | -0.2s Cooldown (Fires faster).                    |
| **4** | +1 Amount.                                        |
| **5** | +10 Base Damage.                                  |
| **6** | +1 Amount.                                        |
| **7** | +10 Base Damage.                                  |
| **8** | +1 Pierce (Projectiles pass through 1 enemy).     |

#### Evolution: קקטוס קדוש (Holy Cactus)

- **Requirement:** Max Level **Sabra** + **ווסאח (Wassach)** [VS: Empty Tome].
- **Mechanic Change:** Cooldown is removed entirely. The weapon fires a continuous stream of projectiles with significantly reduced delay between shots.
- **Satirical Significance:** The "Sabra"—thorny on the outside, sweet on the inside—is the symbol of the native-born Israeli. Weaponizing it as the "starter wand" establishes the game's irreverent tone immediately.

### 3.2 Weapon: כסאות כתר (Keter Chairs)

**VS Equivalent:** Runetracer

#### Mechanical Profile

This weapon launches white plastic Keter chairs that pierce enemies and ricochet off the edges of the screen (or obstacles). It excels in enclosed spaces or high-density crowds.

- **Behavior:** Bouncing / Piercing.
- **Base Damage:** 10
- **Base Cooldown:** 3.0 seconds
- **Physics:** Projectiles have a high `Speed` stat and bounce off screen edges.

#### Progression Table (Levels 1–8)

| Level | Effect / Upgrade                                   |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Base Weapon. Fires a chair that bounces off walls. |
| **2** | +25% Speed.                                        |
| **3** | +5 Base Damage.                                    |
| **4** | +0.4s Duration (Chairs exist longer).              |
| **5** | +1 Amount.                                         |
| **6** | +5 Base Damage.                                    |
| **7** | +1 Amount.                                         |
| **8** | +0.4s Duration.                                    |

#### Evolution: אין עתיד (No Future)

- **Requirement:** Max Level **Keter Chairs** + **פרוטקשן (Protection)** [VS: Armor].
- **Mechanic Change:** Projectiles explode upon every bounce and whenever damage is taken by the player. The chairs multiply and move faster.
- **Satirical Significance:** The Keter chair is the indestructible, ubiquitous furniture of Israel. The evolution name, "No Future," cynically implies that the future holds nothing but an endless storm of flying plastic furniture.

### 3.3 Weapon: כפרות (Chicken Circle)

**VS Equivalent:** King Bible

#### Mechanical Profile

The **Kaparot** manifests as chickens revolving around the player. It acts as a defensive perimeter (orbital shield), damaging enemies that attempt to pass through the ring.

- **Behavior:** Orbital / Area Denial.
- **Base Damage:** 10
- **Base Cooldown:** 3.0 seconds (Determines how often the circle refreshes).
- **Physics:** Requires `Duration` to keep the shield active and `Speed` to increase the rotation velocity (hitting enemies faster).

#### Progression Table (Levels 1–8)

| Level | Effect / Upgrade                               |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Base Weapon. Chickens orbit the player.        |
| **2** | +40% Area (Wider circle).                      |
| **3** | +40% Speed (Faster rotation) & +0.5s Duration. |
| **4** | +10 Base Damage.                               |
| **5** | +1 Amount (More chickens in the ring).         |
| **6** | +40% Area.                                     |
| **7** | +1 Amount.                                     |
| **8** | +10 Base Damage.                               |

#### Evolution: סליחות לא קדושות (Unholy Vespers)

- **Requirement:** Max Level **Kaparot** + **הארכה (extension)** [VS: Spellbinder].
- **Mechanic Change:** The weapon never despawns. The chickens form a permanent, rapidly spinning shield around the player.
- **Satirical Significance:** A direct reference to the Yom Kippur atonement ritual. The evolution name ("Unholy Selichot/Vespers") inverts a prayer for forgiveness into a permanent mechanism of destruction.

### 3.4 Weapon: פיתות (Pitas)

**VS Equivalent:** Axe

#### Mechanical Profile

The **Pitas** are lobbed in a high arc, passing through enemies above the player before falling to deal heavy damage. This weapon has a high damage multiplier but is difficult to aim due to its parabolic trajectory.

- **Behavior:** High Arcing Projectile.
- **Base Damage:** 20
- **Base Cooldown:** 4.0 seconds
- **Physics:** `Area` increases the size of the pitas.

#### Progression Table (Levels 1–8)

| Level | Effect / Upgrade                                   |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Base Weapon. Lobs a pita in a high arc.            |
| **2** | +1 Amount.                                         |
| **3** | +10 Base Damage.                                   |
| **4** | +20% Area.                                         |
| **5** | +1 Amount.                                         |
| **6** | +10 Base Damage.                                   |
| **7** | +20% Area.                                         |
| **8** | +1 Pierce (Pitas pass through 1 additional enemy). |

#### Evolution: בורקס המוות (Burekas of Death)

- **Requirement:** Max Level **Pitas** + **נרות שבת (Shabbat Candles)** [VS: Candelabrador].
- **Mechanic Change:** The projectile behavior changes from an arc to a radial blast. Large, scythe-like Burekas fly outward from the player in all directions, penetrating all enemies.
- **Satirical Significance:** Escalates the threat level of baked goods. The "Burekas of Death" applies the "Death Spiral" mechanic to a flaky pastry, deriving humor from the absurdity of menacing food items.

### 3.5 Weapon: מגן דוד (Star of David)

**VS Equivalent:** Knife

#### Mechanical Profile

The **Star of David** is a projectile weapon that fires in the direction the player is currently facing (or last moved). It requires active positioning and aiming from the player.

- **Behavior:** Directional Linear Projectile.
- **Base Damage:** 6.5
- **Base Cooldown:** 1.0 second
- **Physics:** Highly dependent on `Amount` (to create a wall of projectiles) and `Projectile Speed`.

#### Progression Table (Levels 1–8)

| Level | Effect / Upgrade                               |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Base Weapon. Fires a Star in facing direction. |
| **2** | +1 Amount.                                     |
| **3** | +1 Amount & +5 Base Damage.                    |
| **4** | +1 Amount.                                     |
| **5** | +1 Pierce (Star passes through 1 enemy).       |
| **6** | +1 Amount.                                     |
| **7** | +1 Amount & +5 Base Damage.                    |
| **8** | +1 Pierce.                                     |

#### Evolution: אלף חיתוכים (Thousand Edge)

- **Requirement:** Max Level **Star of David** + **זרוע נטויה (Outstretched Arm)** [VS: Bracer].
- **Mechanic Change:** Removes firing delay. Creates a seamless, machine-gun-like stream of Stars in the facing direction.
- **Satirical Significance:** Trivializes a symbol of immense national and religious weight by turning it into a disposable, spam-able ammunition. The name "Thousand Cuts" implies a painful, relentless assault via iconography.
