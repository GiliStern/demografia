- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Coding Environment

The user asks questions about the following coding languages:

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Prefer extracting nested conditional logic (e.g., multi-level ternaries) into small helper functions for clarity.
- Keep React components lean: move non-render logic (state machines, frame loops, calculations, condition trees) into helpers or custom hooks; components should primarily compose hooks, helpers, and JSX.

This comprehensive guide outlines best practices, conventions, and standards for development with modern web technologies including ReactJS, NextJS, zustand, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks.

    Development Philosophy
    - Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
    - Follow SOLID principles
    - Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative
    - Emphasize type safety and static analysis
    - Practice component-driven development

    Code Implementation Guidelines
    Planning Phase
    - Begin with step-by-step planning
    - Write detailed pseudocode before implementation
    - Document component architecture and data flow
    - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

    Code Style (aligned with eslint.config.js and tsconfig.json)
    - Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
    - Use double quotes for strings unless escaping demands otherwise
    - End statements with semicolons
    - Keep code free of unused variables and parameters
    - Prefer strict equality (===) over loose equality (==)
    - Maintain standard spacing: after keywords, around operators, after commas
    - Keep else on the same line as the closing brace; use braces for multiline blocks
    - Trailing commas are allowed/preferred in multiline literals
    - No enforced 80-character line limit; wrap for readability as needed

    Naming Conventions
    General Rules
    - Use PascalCase for:
      - Components
      - Type definitions
      - Interfaces
      - Component file names (e.g, UserProfile.tsx)
    - Use kebab-case for:
      - Directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
    - Use camelCase for:
      - Variables
      - Functions
      - Methods
      - Hooks
      - Properties
      - Props
      - Helpers/Utils (eg. textHelper.ts)
    - Use UPPERCASE for:
      - Environment variables
      - Constants
      - Global configurations

    Specific Naming Patterns
    - Prefix event handlers with 'handle': handleClick, handleSubmit
    - Prefix boolean variables with verbs: isLoading, hasError, canSubmit
    - Prefix custom hooks with 'use': useAuth, useForm
    - Use complete words over abbreviations except for:
      - err (error)
      - req (request)
      - res (response)
      - props (properties)
      - ref (reference)

    React Best Practices
    Component Architecture
    - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
    - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
    - Implement proper component composition
    - Use React.memo() strategically for performance
    - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

    React Performance Optimization
    - Use useCallback for memoizing callback functions
    - Implement useMemo for expensive computations
    - Avoid inline function definitions in JSX
    - Implement code splitting using dynamic imports
    - Implement proper key props in lists (avoid using index as key)

    Next.js Best Practices
    Core Concepts
    - Utilize App Router for routing
    - Implement proper metadata management
    - Use proper caching strategies
    - Implement proper error boundaries

    Components and Features
    - Use Next.js built-in components:
      - Image component for optimized images
      - Link component for client-side navigation
      - Script component for external scripts
      - Head component for metadata
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Use proper data fetching methods

    Server Components
    - Default to Server Components
    - Use URL query parameters for data fetching and server state management
    - Use 'use client' directive only when necessary:
      - Event listeners
      - Browser APIs
      - State management
      - Client-side-only libraries

    TypeScript Implementation
    - Enable strict mode
    - Define clear interfaces for component props, state, and zustand state structure.
    - Use type guards to handle potential undefined or null values safely - make sure type is actually nullable before applying these measures.
    - Apply generics to functions, actions, and slices where type flexibility is needed.
    - Utilize TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) for cleaner and reusable code.
    - Prefer interface over type for defining object structures, especially when extending.
    - Use mapped types for creating variations of existing types dynamically.

    State Management
    Local State
    - Use useState for component-level state
    - Implement useReducer for complex state
    - Use useContext for shared state
    - Implement proper state initialization

    Global State
    - Use zustand for global state
    - Use createSlice to define state, reducers, and actions together.
    - Avoid using createReducer and createAction unless necessary.
    - Normalize state structure to avoid deeply nested data.
    - Use selectors to encapsulate state access.
    - Avoid large, all-encompassing slices; separate concerns by feature.


    Error Handling and Validation
    Form Validation
    - Use Zod for schema validation
    - Implement proper error messages
    - Use proper form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

    Error Boundaries
    - Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component trees gracefully.
    - Log caught errors to an external service (e.g., Sentry) for tracking and debugging.
    - Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur, keeping users informed without breaking the app.

    Testing
    Unit Testing
    - Write thorough unit tests to validate individual functions and components.
    - Use Jest and React Testing Library for reliable and efficient testing of React components.
    - Follow patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert to ensure clarity and consistency in tests.
    - Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate unit tests.

    Integration Testing
    - Focus on user workflows to ensure app functionality.
    - Set up and tear down test environments properly to maintain test independence.
    - Use snapshot testing selectively to catch unintended UI changes without over-relying on it.
    - Leverage testing utilities (e.g., screen in RTL) for cleaner and more readable tests.

    Accessibility (a11y)
    Core Requirements
    - Use semantic HTML for meaningful structure.
    - Apply accurate ARIA attributes where needed.
    - Ensure full keyboard navigation support.
    - Manage focus order and visibility effectively.
    - Maintain accessible color contrast ratios.
    - Follow a logical heading hierarchy.
    - Make all interactive elements accessible.
    - Provide clear and accessible error feedback.

    Security
    - Implement input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Use DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML content.
    - Use proper authentication methods.

    Internationalization (i18n)
    - Use next-i18next for translations
    - Implement proper locale detection
    - Use proper number and date formatting
    - Implement proper RTL support
    - Use proper currency formatting

    Documentation
    - Use JSDoc for documentation
    - Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
    - Add examples when appropriate
    - Use complete sentences with proper punctuation
    - Keep descriptions clear and concise
    - Use proper markdown formatting
    - Use proper code blocks
    - Use proper links
